# LCC_HVDC

A library for simulating line-commutated converter high voltage direct current (LCC HVDC) systems. This library is open source and free of use. This feature is an advantage over the exsiting libraries that are available in closed source tools for LCC HVDC studies.

## Library scope in brief

LCC_HVDC is a library that we created with Modelica language for simulation of high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems that are based on line-commutated converters (LCC). Modelica, as an open-source language, employs mathematical equations within its coding framework. This characteristic makes it easier to grasp the functioning of components and streamlines their reuse when needed. This library addresses the current demands of power system operators, offering a solution for sharing simulation models with reduced complexity. 

## Where to Commence?

You can open this library with a Modelica tool like OpenModelica or Dymola. It comprises of two subpackages namely "Models" and "Examples". In the former, every model has a description in the "Documentation Browser". Under "Examples", a test is provided to clearly exemplify each model with an illustration available in the documentation browser.

## Maintainers

This library is developed by the following peaple all of which are from the University of Pisa, department of Energy, Systems, Territory and Construction (DESTEC):
* Mohammad Babaeifar (PhD student) mohammad.babaeifar@phd.unipi.it
* Professor Massimo Ceraolo (Full Professor of Electric Power Systems) massimo.ceraolo@unipi.it
