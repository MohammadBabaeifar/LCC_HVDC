# LCC_HVDC

A library for simulating line commutated converter high voltage direct current (LCC HVDC) systems.

## Library scope in brief

LCC_HVDC is a library that we created with Modelica language for simulation of high voltage direct current (HVDC) systems that are based on line commutated converters (LCC). Modelica, as an open-source language, employs mathematical equations within its coding framework. This characteristic makes it easier to grasp the functioning of components and streamlines their reuse when needed. This library addresses the current demands of power system operators, offering a solution for sharing simulation models with reduced complexity. 

## Where to Commence?

You can open this library with a Modelica tool like OpenModelica or Dymola. Every model has a description in the "Documentation Browser".
